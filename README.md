# Google Sheets Scripts

**Script Collection**

_Version: R1.00_

## üéØ Repository Purpose:
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive collection of scripts designed for automating a range of tasks for my own personal usage.

These scripts aim to enhance productivity üöÄ, reduce manual effort üõ†Ô∏è, and streamline processes across various domains such as file management, data processing, system administration, and random items. These all served their purpose and have avoided a lot of personal hours.
